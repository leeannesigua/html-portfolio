<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Lee Anne Sigua. I have always been fascinated by computers since I the dial-up age. I was curious 
  about how they worked from the inside and out, but I never knew that I can make a career of it.</p>

<p>I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Computer Science. After graduating, I got a Web Development
  Certificate from Grossmont College, but I still felt like I did not learn enough. I'm taking Full Stack Development courses
  on Udemy.com in order to expand my knowlegde and skills in full stack development. 
</p>

<p>This webpage was created while taking full stack development courses online and it showcases the projects that I have done 
  during the these courses. There is a lot of improvment in my work and my goal is to have my skills and dedication shown through 
  these projects.
